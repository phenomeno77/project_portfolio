                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" 
                    JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World");</code>

                Declaring Variables
            </header>
            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                  With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                  syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                  <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                  generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                  variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> or 
                  <code> let x = 3.</code>. This syntax can be used to declare a block 
                  scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                </p>

                Global Variables
            </header>
            <article>
                <p>
                  Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                  pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                  variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
      
                <p>
                  Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                  or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                  frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                  declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                  iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
              <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                    <li>
                      null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                      JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                      NULL, or any other variant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                    </li>
                    <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                    <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                    <li>
                      Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                      are unique and immutable.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
    
                <li>and Object</li>
              </ul>
              Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
              you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
              functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
              think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
              procedures that your application can perform.
